===================================================================================
This is a simple example that create a server on port 8080:
- Listen for incomming request 
- parse it to verify syntax of the request, if OK get HTTP-message portion of the request (the whole request)   
then send back to the client the HTTP-message following a 200 OK 
- if syntax error send back 400 error 


===================================================================================


**** compile main.c with: 

gcc -I ../libparser -I ../librequest-0.3/api  -L ../libparser -L ../librequest-0.3 -o main main.c -lparser -lrequest


where:  -I points to include directory 
	-L points to libraries directory 

**** launch it with: 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. 
./server

**** Server will isten on 8080 TCP port. 
**** Server will wait for a request 
**** Server will analyse the request and 
****** If the request's syntax is ok answer as an echo server 
****** If the request's sytax is not OK will answer a error response 

**** And enjoy getting a 200 OK response, when you send it a  HTTP request with a remote client ==> 

	firefox http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 
OR... 
	nc -C 127.0.0.1 8080
